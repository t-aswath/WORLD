Ag-NPs were fabricated by enzymatic reduction of AgNO3 using two lignin-degrading fungus Aspergillus flavus (AfAg-NPs) and Emericella nidulans (EnAg-NPs). The prepared Ag-NPs were characterized by different spectroscopic techniques. Antibacterial activity of prepared Ag-NPs was demonstrated against selected Gram negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria in the term of minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and susceptibility constant (Z). The synergistic antibacterial activity of Ag-NPs with four conventional antibiotics was also determined by the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) using the checkerboard microdilution method.

Fabricated AGNPs were characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy, particle size, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopic (TEM) analyses. The typical surface plasmon resonance peak of AGNP was recorded at 410\u202fnm, as confirmed from UV–vis spectrum. Synthesized AGNPs displayed spherical shape and face centric cubic structure with average size of 10–50\u202fnm. In-vitro cytotoxicity assay using MCF-7 cancer cell line revealed that the extracted lignin was non-toxic while AGNPs displayed toxicity at both 5 and 50\u202fμg/ml concentrations, respectively. Evaluation of the sensing property of AGNPs suggested that the lignin stabilized silver nanoparticles have potential to detect the concentration of heavy metal ions up to nanomolar range\xa0…', 'Total citations': '127', 'URL': 'https://scholar.google.com//citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=fOBhwLAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=fOBhwLAAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC', 'Category': 'JOURNAL', 'Publication Date': None, 'Total Citations': None, 'Year': '2019', 'Index': ' Science Citation Index Expanded ', 'Issn': ' 2213-2929 / 2213-3437 '}, {'Title': 'Biodegradation of Malachite Green by the Ligninolytic Fungus Aspergillus flavus', 'Authors': 'Anand Barapatre, Keshaw Ram Aadil, Harit Jha', 'Publication date': '2017/4', 'Journal': 'CLEAN–Soil, Air, Water', 'Volume': '45', 'Issue': '4', 'Pages': '1600045', 'Description': " The azo class of synthetic dyes represents one of the most industrially used dyes as well as a major class of environmental contaminants, which possess one or more azo bonds (\uf8ffN\uf8feN\uf8ff) along with aromatic rings and sulfonic groups. Due to its recalcitrant nature and toxicity for animals and human beings, the elimination of these dyes from the environment is essential. The present study focuses on the biodegradation of such azo dye, malachite green (MG), through a potent ligninolytic fungus, Aspergillus flavus (F10). A. flavus (F10) completely decolorized MG (150\u2009mg\u2009L−1) within 6–8 days in optimized Kirk's basal medium under static aerobic conditions at pH 5.8. Sucrose and sodium nitrate were efficient carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively.

The properties of the film was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The lignin-PLA film demonstrated a significant decrease in swelling ratio and tensile strength in contrast to PLA film. SEM analysis revealed proper blending of lignin into PLA matrix with slightly rough surface. Film was thermostable and amorphous in nature as confirmed from the thermal study and XRD analysis, respectively.

The alkali lignin degradation was checked in term of disappearance of lignin content and colority. Selected fungus, degraded 19–41.6% of alkali lignin (0.25%, w/v) within 21\xa0days of incubation and reduced the colority up to 14.4–21%. The activity of ligninolytic enzymes was periodically checked.
